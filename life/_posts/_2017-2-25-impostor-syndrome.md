Every now and again, I have that dreadful realization that I'm maybe not super great at what I do. Sometimes I may feel I'm pretty bad at StarCraft. Usually it's about my job or programming.

For a long time, I let that feeling reside in my guts. I agreed with the stewed thoughts: If I haven't accomplished anything yet, will I ever? Would it even matter? There's little chance my work will ever be groundbreaking, or even noticed by a substantial audience. Why put myself through the trouble?

It took a long time for me to come out of that funk. I'll admit, every now and then that dread will wash over me, but it's infrequent. I wish I could detail what I did to overcome my [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) (and bit of [Dunningâ€“Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)), but I can't. What I _can_ offer, at least, is some words of encouragement for others facing these issues.
