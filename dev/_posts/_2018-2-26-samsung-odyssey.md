- install process took a few hours
  - needed windows 10 "creators edition"
    - installation didnt work a few times so it took a few hours to actually get the damn thing updated
  - during setup, controllers failed to connect via bluetooth several times. after sheer persistence managed to get both connected
    - actually ahd to go into the windows bluetooth settings to connect as the Odyssey setup program wouldn't work
  
- finally have it working, boot into the home experience
  - lenses are much nicer than the vive
    - clearer, much larger 'sweet spot'
    - far fewer god rays
    - lenses seem harder than vive's which means less scratches
    - noticed there is some weird distortion when looking around
  
  - physical design is generally a lot better than the vive
    - easier to put on, adjust
    - does not feel like you have a heavy HMD on your face
    - but i dont think it would work well for glasses
    - headphones worked surprisingly well

- after playing a bit
