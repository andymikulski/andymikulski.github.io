# WebTorrent-based Television

[takes a user's local file and then streams it via web torrent]

[syncs all users' videos to the same time]

[irc chatroom enables users to chat about the video they are watching]


#### But, why?

- [inspired by nickreboot.com (RIP)]
- [cause it's neat, challenging]
- [something my friends would use]

# About

- [uses webtorrents to seed files via webrtc]
- [node server uses socket.io to keep audience in sync]

# Nick's Ghost

- [irc companion, sits in chat and accepts commands to change what's playing]
- [acts as seeder, reads local file storage to provide options to users]
- [offers 3 random choices when a video is about to end, users can vote on what plays next]
- [provides irc operations to set +o, mute, etc]

# Postmortem

- [got it working eventually, took a while though]
- [webrtc, webtorrent are both kinda fickle, sometimes would work perfectly but not always]
- [super fun once it worked]
- [issues with: changing videos (would not change for all users), ram usage, etc.]
  - [mostly webrtc/webtorrent stuff, since it's a younger technology]
