### The Premise

As part of a programming challenge, I was tasked with recreating a peg solitaire game. Peg solitaire is a game you've probably played before:

1. You must jump each peg over another peg, but only if there is an open space.
2. Each peg you jump over must be removed from the game.
3. You win if only one peg is left.

### Postmortem

Given the time constraint of three days, and self-assigning the task of building the game from scratch, I'm very happy with the result! I tackled a lot of technical challenges that probably weren't really meant to be touched on, but 


### 

By the end of the challenge, I had implemented the primary mechanics of peg solitaire, as well as handful of other features to make the game a little more interesting.
