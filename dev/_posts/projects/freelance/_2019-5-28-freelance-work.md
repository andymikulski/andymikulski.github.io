In 2018, I spent a short time working for Serenity Forge as a Gameplay Engineer, primarily responsible for principal code design, implementing gameplay features, QA, and general bugfixing. Beyond the usual developer duties, I also served as an 'internal developer advocate,' working to streamline internal processes and ensuring engineers follow proper standards, perform code reviews, etc.

Below, you can find some more information regarding the projects I worked on during my tenure at Serenity Forge.
