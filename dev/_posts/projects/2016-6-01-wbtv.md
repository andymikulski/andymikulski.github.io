# About

The project was initially inspired by [nickreboot.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150303023202/http://www.nickreboot.com) (RIP), which streamed 90's Nickelodeon shows 24/7, and offered a chatroom for viewers.

Since NR heavily utilized Flash (for most of its lifespan), I was interested in recreating a modernized version of the site.

As bandwidth is an issue for streaming, I was interested in finding a technical solution around having to pay for content servers or a cloud service. [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) seemed like the perfect fit. Syncing players was a matter of requesting the current playback time from the host server, and WebTorrent afforded the ability to provide different video qualities for the stream (see below).

# Quick Technical Overview

The entire system is based around the [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) library, allowing us to distribute files and stream them as if they were regular torrents! The audience can download the file as they watch, then seed to new viewers that join later. The WebTorrent ecosystem has packages for WebRTC compatible [DHT](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-dht) and [tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker) servers, as well.

A node script reads content from a specified local directory, creates torrents when requested, initially seeds those torrents, and provides a convenient IRC-based chatbot which accepts commands to skip, pause, poll the chat, etc.

[Diet WBtv](http://diet.wayback.tv) uses WebTorrent to connect and consume the stream. As the video plays, the backend syncs each audience member's stream to the same timestamp.

>Initially, a more amibitous viewing site was put together at [WaybackTV](http://www.wayback.tv/), but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. As a result, I&nbsp;created&nbsp;Diet&nbsp;WBtv&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;MVP.

<label>An early plan for WBtv was to create separate channels with show queues.</label>


# Remote Control

Along with the hosting script comes an assistant IRC bot named `Remote Control`. RC handles stream-related functions such as rewinding or voting for what's next, as well as basic IRC commands (such as opping or muting chatters).

> The idea to use an IRC bot instead of implenting controls into the site UI is to keep users chatting. By avoiding the mouse entirely, the user doesn't lose focus of what the audience is saying, and the user remains engaged.

RC will offer a few random choices when a video is about to end. Users can vote (via IRC) what plays next, and that's how the queue is decided.

# Postmortem

It took a long time to get the base concept working, but once it did, it was super fun. A few problems remain:

- WebRTC is fickle. In some tests, everything will work perfectly. The next run, nothing will connect. This could also be the fact the code is pretty rough.
- On DWBtv, changing videos sometimes don't change for all users. Using the big red `Refresh` button usually works, but is also unreliable. Again, the code is pretty rough.
- The system does not account for latency, i.e. a user with slow internet will always be behind other viewers, as the API does not consider the RTT when requested for the current playback time.
- Realistically, I should just rewrite the entire thing. Again.

# Also, It's a Death Ray

<label>"You know, my wife will be happy. She's hated this whole death ray thing from day one."</label>

While there _are_ some 'good' applications for this sort of project (such as online classes), realistically it can quickly go outside legal boundaries. As a result, I don't attempt or intend to make this project anything more than just something glued together so my friends and I can watch videos together.

That said, it IS a pretty fun project to talk about and work on.
