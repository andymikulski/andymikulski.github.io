[Mondo Robot](https://mondorobot.com/) is a small digital service agency based in Boulder, CO, offering everything from brand redesigns to developed websites and applications for clients such as Coachella, Ret√ºl, and the Michael J. Fox Foundation. As both a full-time and contractual creative developer for MR, I've worked on the front-end for many projects, which you'll find below.

# MondoRobot.com (2019)
#### Page Transition Animations

For the redesign of their company website, I was tasked with working together with in-house designers to research and code dynamic page and menu transitions. Using SVG filters such as [feTurbulence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/feTurbulence) and [feDisplacementMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/feDisplacementMap) in tandem with [CSS Masks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask), I was able to take a vision exported from AfterEffects and convert it into functional Vue code.

<label>This demo video shows a few effects in action: blurring the hero video, using displacement and turbulence to get a wavy effect, and a masked interstitial image when opening the global navigation. The interstitial image of the [Flatirons rock formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatirons) was created using an animated CSS mask and clever use of CSS property transitions.</label>

<label>Here, the `feTurbulence` and `feDisplacement` filters are seen applied to the global navigation page links, including an exit mask animation when navigating to another page.</label>

<!-- <p>Unfortunately, the use of the SVG filters proved to require a strong machine to run at the desired framerate. As a result, the effects were stripped down for launch, but there is an ongoing effort to get these effects into the production site!</p> -->

# [LiquidDeath.com (2019)](/liquid-death)

Liquid Death Mountain Water is an extreme canned water brand. I was brought on to create the e-commerce site and "Sell Your Soul" promo functionality. You can [read more about the project here](/liquid-death).

<label>Shopify was used for the e-commerce piece of the site, paired with custom code to extend functionality for both end users and those who manage the site's back end.</label>

<label>Custom code was included in the site for the users to sell their soul for a free can of water. My duties included building out the functionality for users to digitally sign a legally-binding "soul contract."</label>

# MondoRobot.com (2015)
<p>For their previous site, I was tasked with creating an interesting 'page fold' transition animation between pages. Using CSS3 transforms (and a bit of math), I was able to create the effect shown above. After building a prototype, I was able to integrate the effect into the site's existing CoffeeScript/Angular codebase.</p>

# [WhistlerBlackcomb.com (2015)](https://web.archive.org/web/20150723233339/http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/)

Mondo Robot was given the opportunity to revamp the iconic ski resort's outdated website, in which I was given responsibility over the entire front-end codebase. Using Sitecore as a back end, and jQuery in the front end (it _was_ 2015), we developed an entirely new site consisting of CMS-driven pages and API-driven data visualizations for trail status and weather conditions.

# [The M.A.X. Ski Pass (2015)](https://web.archive.org/web/20151104184855/http://themaxpass.com/)


My first project with Mondo Robot! The M.A.X. Ski Pass offered customers a season ski pass with access to 20+ mountains across North America. Though essentially a single-page site, I was able to integrate some interesting animations and interactions, which was pretty exciting for a junior dev such as myself at the time.

<label>An example of an animations I was able to put into the site. This sort of 'fun' interaction would become a staple of my front-end development.</label>
