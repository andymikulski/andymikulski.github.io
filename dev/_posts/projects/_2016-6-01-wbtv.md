# About

The concept is pretty simple: an online TV station. Users can go to the site, tune into the stream, and chat with others. WaybackTV was an attempt to create such an online TV station, using WebRTC + WebTorrents as the underlying content-serving infrastructure.

The project was initially inspired by [nickreboot.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150303023202/https://www.nickreboot.com) (RIP), which streamed 90's Nickelodeon shows 24/7, and offered a chatroom for viewers. Since NR heavily utilized Flash (for most of its lifespan), I was interested in recreating a modernized version of the site.

As bandwidth is an issue for streaming, I was interested in finding a technical solution around having to pay for content servers or a cloud service. [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) seemed like the perfect fit. Syncing players was a matter of requesting the current playback time from the host server, and WebTorrent afforded the ability to provide different video qualities for the stream (see below).

# Quick Technical Overview

The entire system is based around the [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) library, allowing us to distribute files and stream them as if they were regular torrents! The audience can download the file as they watch, then seed to new viewers that join later. The WebTorrent ecosystem has packages for WebRTC compatible [DHT](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-dht) and [tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker) servers, as well.

A node script reads content from a specified local directory, creates torrents when requested, initially seeds those torrents, and provides a convenient IRC-based chatbot which accepts commands to skip, pause, poll the chat, etc. As the video plays, the script-controlled backend syncs each audience member's stream to the same timestamp.

<label>An early plan for WBtv was to create separate channels with show queues. Eventually, I realized I had enough on my hands just getting _one_ stream to work, so this idea was shelved for another rewrite.</label>


#### Remote Control

Along with the hosting script comes an assistant IRC bot named `Remote Control`. RC serves essentially as an IRC 'command-line' tool for operating the stream. Users can vote what plays next, and administrators can use RC to rewind/skip/pause/etc using simple commands.

The idea to use an IRC bot over using site UI is to keep users chatting - by avoiding the mouse entirely, the user doesn't lose focus of what the audience is saying, and keeps them engaged with the ongoing discussion. Beyond that, it side-steps the problem of getting the user's attention somewhere else on the page while they are focused on the chat/stream area.

# Postmortem

Though the system went through several rewrites, inherent flaws and defects in the overall system architecture ultimately prevented this project from really being a success. A quick summary:

- WebRTC, in my experience, is a little fickle. Sometimes users would not be able to connect and would require a hard page refresh, and sometimes connections would spontaneously drop, preventing the stream from displaying the correct video.
- None of the systems I developed accounted for latency, at all. This means that stream for a viewer that's geographically farther from me than another viewer will _always_ be a few seconds behind. This is not a difficult fix, just something I was unaware of at the time I made WB.
- The code is pretty gnarly, and I'd love to take a stab at writing another version. I think that'd be version 6 or 7, though, and at a certain point I should just call it quits.

# Also, It's a Death Ray

While there _are_ some 'good' applications for this sort of project (such as online classes), realistically it can quickly go outside legal boundaries. As a result, this project will never really see the light of day, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a blast to get working.

    <label>Transferring videos over WebRTC means that some data can be dropped, and video can play with corrupted/incomplete data, resulting in this sort of artifacting.</label>
