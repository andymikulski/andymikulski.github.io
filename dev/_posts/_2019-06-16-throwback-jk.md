<!-- One of my favorite things about game programming is the accidental and emergent behavior that shows up as you're working a problem. With mechanics, this usually amounts to an unexpected bug and a funny post on Twitter. When working on visual code such as shaders, though, you stumble into a new territory: accidental generative art. -->

<!-- The term "generative art" typically reminds me of [Processing](https://processing.org/), a language and set of software used to programmatically create visual designs using primitive shapes, textures, etc. In this article, though, I'll be briefly examining a broken/inaccurate ray tracer as the source of our art - no `for` loops with repeating geometric shapes here.

In this post, I'll examine a handful of renderings I produced while working on a ray tracer of my own. I plan to post a technical overview of my renderer (with demo) in the near future. For now, let's take a quick look at how ray tracing actually works, and how it ties into our "art." -->
