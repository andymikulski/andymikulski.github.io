# Small Utilities for a Small URL

[mkl.ski](http://mkl.ski/) is a simple website full of random utilities, which would otherwise be provided by third-party sites such as pastebin or tinyurl.

After finding that the domain was available, I could see the benefit of having a 'personalized' short URL service... So I bought the name and made it.

# Technical Details
- [uses redis on the backend cause i wanted lookups to be fast, probably unnecessary though]
- [pastebin shows time to render in bottom right of page]
- [still on heroku free tier, need to switch it over to something else]
- [would like to hook it up to an s3 bucket and provide image hosting]
- [uses blueprintjs on the front end because I didn't want to think too hard on this one]
