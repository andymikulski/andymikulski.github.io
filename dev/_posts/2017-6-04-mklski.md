This weekend's goal was to create a small utility site to replace functionality provided by sites such as pastebin or tinyurl.

### Features

- URL shortener (ex: `https://mkl.ski/u/abc123`)
  - Expires after duration (if any)
- Pastebin (ex: `https://mkl.ski/s/abc123`)
  - Markdown supported
  - `/raw` endpoint gives plaintext content
  - Can be `curl`ed from the command line!
  - Expires after duration (if any)

# Technical Details
- With the goal of speed in mind, I used [redis](https://redis.io/) for data storage.
  - Since strings are the only type of data being saved, it worked out well with redis' key-value store.
  - Using redis also afforded pastes/URLs expirations which were trivial to implement.
  - The pastebin feature actually displays the time it took to load/render in the bottom right of the page!
- Backend is super simple: node + redis
- Frontend is a simple React app, using [BlueprintJS](https://blueprintjs.com/) for UI components.
  - Since this was a quick project, I didn't care to spend much time building components.
  - Also, this was an opportunity for me to evaluate BlueprintJS.

# Future Plans

- Image Hosting
  - I'd like to add image hosting to the site, though that would require dealing with actually hosting images and so on.

- Hosting the site locally
  - Currently, I use a simple (free tier) Heroku app.
  - I love the idea of using a Raspberry Pi to host the web server, and later the storage device(s) for image hosting.
