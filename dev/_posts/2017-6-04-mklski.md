# About

- [easy to do]
- [uses blueprintjs on the front end because I didn't want to think too hard on this one]
- [would like to hook it up to an s3 bucket and provide image hosting]
- [still on heroku free tier, need to switch it over to something else]
- [uses redis on the backend cause i wanted lookups to be fast, probably unnecessary though]
- [pastebin feature supports markdown]
- [pastebin shows time to render in bottom right of page]
