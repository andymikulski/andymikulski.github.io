# Small Utilities for a Small URL

mkl.ski is a simple website full of random utilities, which would otherwise be provided by third-party sites such as pastebin or tinyurl.

After finding that the domain was available, I could see the benefit of having a 'personalized' short URL service... So I bought the name and made it.

  - `/raw` endpoint gives plaintext content
  - Can be `curl`ed from the command line!

# Technical Details
- With the goal of speed in mind, I used [redis](https://redis.io/) for data storage.
  - Since strings are the only type of data being saved, it worked out well with redis' key-value store.
  - Using redis also afforded pastes/URLs expirations which were trivial to implement.
  - The pastebin feature actually displays the time it took to load/render in the bottom right of the page!
- Backend is super simple: node + redis
- Frontend is a simple React app, using [BlueprintJS](http://blueprintjs.com/) for UI components.
  - Since this was a quick project, I didn't care to spend much time building components.
  - Also, this was an opportunity for me to evaluate BlueprintJS.

# Future Plans

- Image Hosting
  - I'd like to add image hosting to the site, though that would require dealing with actually hosting images and so on.

- Hosting the site locally
  - Currently, I use a simple (free tier) Heroku app.
  - I love the idea of using a Raspberry Pi to host the web server, and later the storage device(s) for image hosting.
