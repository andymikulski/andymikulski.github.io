# Concept

A [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) is the use of a celestial body's gravitational field to alter a spacecraft's speed/path.

In this game, you pilot a spaceship through short bursts of fuel and the gravitational pulls of the planets and moons around you.

>_Technically_, the game is more based on the [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect) (powered flybys) than the slingshot effect used for a gravitational assist.

#### Play It

You can find a beta WebGL build of the game [here](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/WJPjJOJq4M/)!

# Project Details

- **Development time (to date)** ~2 Months
- **Engine** Unity 5.5
- **Team** Solo

# About

- [rick bugged me to make a game]
- [first unity project, figured why not]
- [interesting learning experience, but code is garbage]

# Postmortem

- [the game is really hard]
- [falls into the trap of playing it a lot so i'm good and think it's easier for others]
- [designing levels is really tough]
- [difficult to create reproducible paths to determine par]

#### In the future...

- [invest in some sort of level design tooling]
- [visual treatment could be way better]
- [mobile-friendly design/assets]
