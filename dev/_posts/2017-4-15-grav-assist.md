# Concept

A [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist) is the use of a celestial body's gravitational field to alter a spacecraft's speed/path. In this game, you pilot a spaceship through short bursts of fuel and the gravitational pulls of the planets and moons around you.

[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)): you know it, you love it, and now it's in THREE dimensions.

#### Play It

You can find a beta WebGL build of the game [here](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/WJPjJOJq4M/)!

### Technicality

_Technically_, the game is more based on the [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect) (powered flybys) than the slingshot effect used for a gravitational assist. But, I liked the name *Gravity Assist* better than *The Oberth Effect*.
