# Profanity linter

Node-based CLI tool which finds variations of profane words within code/documents and throws errors accordingly. Useful for preventing debug statements and unprofessional comments from being committed to git.

- [reports line number and number of occurrences]
- [helps prevent committing the classic `wtf` debugging comments]
- [can do `wtf`, `wtffff`, `wwwtttfffff` etc]
- [can also detect number/letter substitution (e.g. H3110 is parsed as `hello`)]
