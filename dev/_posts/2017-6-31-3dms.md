### About

This project was conceived some time ago, and I've only recently been able to make it a reality. The concept of a 3D minesweeper in itself has been explored before, however. A quick internet search brings up a few online variants, and even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)#/media/File:Cube_Minesweeper_3D.png) has an example of 3D gameplay.

Since I was not working towards 'breaking new ground' with the game conventions, I approached the game as a learning project. To that end, I was able to get my hands dirty with dynamic object/prefab instantiation within Unity, recursive grid clearing, and general performance profiling methods.

### Problems Encountered

two major issues

- requires player to maintain a greater sense of the context they're observing
	- observing an edge node with a high count means that they must then inspect the neighboring context, and so on
- it's sort of visually overwhelming
	- many nodes, which end up layering
	- not easily determined what each node is actually connected to
		- diaganols? faces?
		- explored in a blog post


### Midmortem

Ultimately, I think this is a project worth finishing. I like the idea of making a mobile-friendly version of the game, which would require a bit more

#### Virtual Reality

This would be a great experience in VR, so I'd like to explore that avenue in the future. VR affords a handful of useful UX tools that would benefit the somewhat complicated controls that are currently in place. Simply having a second hand for natural controls in itself would be a huge boon to the player's immersion.
