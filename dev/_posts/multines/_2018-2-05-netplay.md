# Introduction

Some time ago, I had an idea on how I could possibly create a multiplayer NES experience for the web. The idea was pretty basic: simply run the inputs from one player to the other! Packed with my bit of [socket.io](https://socket.io/) from that one chat demo I had put together in a few minutes, I was sure I could get this thing working. And I did! But it was a long path to get there.

Initially, I hoped to simply use someone else's emulator, as I was keen on testing out my multiplayer idea, and not necessarily re-emulating the wheel. Unfortunately, there wasn't an emulator available that offered an API for programattic control. Most packages/library offered "full-scale" solutions, in that they attempted to be an entire application. For instance, [WebNES](https://peteward44.github.io/WebNES/index_app.html) offers UI elements for loading ROMs, adjusting volume, etc.

### Cloning WebNES

I will say here and now: my work stands on the shoulders of giants. Without finding Pete Ward's [WebNES repo](https://github.com/peteward44/webnes), my project would not have gone anywhere. WebNES offered a lot from the start: support for most games, WebGL + shader capability, and save states could painlessly be imported/exported. Having never worked with an emulator before, it was also easy to approach the pure javascript codebase.

I forked WebNES, and with the intention of a complete overhaul into 'modern' javascript, renamed the project [nES6](/dev/nes6/). For more information on tha conversion, check out the [project page](/dev/nes6/). Ultimately, after some work, nES6 now has an API which allows for inputs to be controlled programatically, and the MultiNES dream could live on.

# First Networking Attempt

The first iteration of my 'netplay' attempt was the realization of a simple idea I had. If each person ran their own emulator instance, one could simply communicate the input events and keep all emulators in sync. In terms of code, it's simple to capture inputs, fire them over a websocket, and sync gamestates every few seconds so all connected users stay in sync. While the approach sounds _mildly adequate_ on paper, there were glaring flaws with this approach.

Generally, the abundant issues could be boiled down to the fact the inputs were inaccurately timed across emulator instances. As P1 would play, their local gamestate and inputs would be transmitted as soon as they were entered, and the audience would consume those inputs on their own local emulator as soon as they were received. This works great if you're testing on the same machine with zero latency between connections, but in the real world...

The above video depicts the basic concept of the approach: inputs on one side are sent to the other side. You'll notice the games almost immediately desynchronize. This demo does not include game state reconciliation, which means the problem simply compounds and the two games diverge completely from one another.

I knew there was _something_ I could do to fix the problems, but I didn't know what it was. After a handful of futile attempts to make the thing playable, I shelved the project.



# Multiplayer Game Programming: The Book

_Months pass. Dust collects on the codebase._

Eventually, I received [Multiplayer Game Programming](https://smile.amazon.com/Multiplayer-Game-Programming-Architecting-Networked-ebook/dp/B0189RXWJQ) as a gift from my mother! Thanks, Mom.

The book covers a wide range of topic surrounding netcode and multiplayer gaming. The authors cover two patterns to running multiplayer servers and architecting your game to compensate for lag, interpolate between frames, etc. One pattern was more fitting for games where only the most recent info was important (such as position in first-person shooters). The other pattern was the `lockstep turn`, in which games stay in sync via fixed-length 'turns'. The book makes note that this method is appropriate for RTS games, where all actions in the game are important and must be accounted for.

It dawned on me that the NES is similar to a generic RTS game, and I saw hope for MultiNES. As with an RTS, all player inputs matter and must be entered at the absolute correct time. With that in mind, I was able to adapt the lockstep turn pattern to my NES server problem.

Following RTS conventions, each player (and server) must run its own emulator independently. With some work, I could expose APIs within nES6 for interacting with the emulator's internal frame counter. With that API, I can bind events to frames and consistently fire events or callbacks across emulators, despite lag or fluctuating frame rates.

> Note that what I've ultimately implemented for nES6 is more **inspired by** lockstep turns than a direct implementation of what's outlined in the book.

# Implementing Netplay, or: How I Got The Thing To Work

A simple node-backed websocket server handles incoming connections, grouping players into lobbies, etc. For each lobby, a headless emulator instance is created on the server. On game start, the server starts just slightly ahead of the players' games. 

- Server runs headless copy of nES6, handles lobbying, etc
- On game start, server figures out RTT's for each client, then starts its game. Tells clients to begin playing after a certain buffer period (based on the greatest client RTT).
  - Server runs a little ahead of the clients
	- On client input, server broadcasts the input action, as well as the frame number to process it on
	- Client then receives the input from the server, and fires the input locally when the relevant frame happens
- In heartbeats, clients will tell the server what their current frame their emulator is on
  - If the client is too far behind the server's expected frame range (FPS is low, user switched tabs, etc), server tells other players to pause and wait a few frames
	- If the client is too far ahead of the server, that client is paused for some frames until it is back into the 'acceptable' range

#### On Frames versus Time
- Initially, tested syncing messages/inputs through timestamps and messing with RTT's
- Worked pretty well, however ran into issues with: different system clocks, different/fluctuating frame rates, etc
- Using nES6's frame counter allows actions to be entered into local emulators consistently across all players.
  - Frame dips, lag, switching window tab, etc wont mess with the inputs entering the emulator
	- This is especially important to note since the NES random number generator is based on inputs and when they were entered. Two emulators receiving the same inputs at slightly different times will result in different 'randomness' in-game. (In Tecmo Super Bowl, coin flips would not match, for instance.)


### Ensured Messages
- Though relatively unimportant, I was interested in implementing `ensured messages`.
- Essentially, I wanted the client and server to acknowledge when they received each other's messages.
- This is useful to not only account for dropped packets, but to also enforce packet order.

- Server has a counter for each client, and prefixes messages with that number when sent to the client (incrementing with each sent message)
- In the event the packet is NOT dropped:
  - Client receives message, acknowledges to the server it was received, and examines packet number.
	- If it's the expected packet, it's processed immediately. If it's _not_ expected, it hangs onto it in a cache, but that's it.
- In the event the packet IS dropped, and the client never receives it:
  - Server waits a moment (based on RTT) to re-send the message, and continues to do so until the client acknowledges (or disconnects).
	- Optionally, you could set a 'attempt count' and set the system so it just acknowledges the packet as 'dropped' and move on. This is unacceptable for our needs, so the server simply tries indefinitely to ensure the message is delivered.

### Input Rollback
- In the event a client receives an input late (the frame has already passed), this is an issue. The NES requires all inputs to be set at the correct frame in order to stay in sync.
- Clients save their local state every 50 frames, and store a list of player inputs that happened since that savestate's frame.
- If an input is entered late, the client will: pause its emulator, load the most recent savestate, execute each player input that's happened since that frame (including the late input the client just received), and resume emulation.
  - Basically, it replays the game and tries to drop the player back to where they should be.

- This is still buggy - technically players should never really get ahead of the server.
- Regardless, sometimes rollbacks will disregard player input or worse, simply desync and break the emulator.
