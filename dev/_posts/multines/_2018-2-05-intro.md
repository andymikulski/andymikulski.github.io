### Getting Started

The first step was to get my hands messy and see what things looked like. WebNES was built using grunt, bower, and jQuery - all relics of front-end methods from years past. The starting tasks were fairly simple, though generally time-consuming:

- Switch dependency management from bower to npm/package.json
- Implement ES6 `class`es and remove all the `prototype` business.
  - Some functionality was able to be abstracted, such as the Emitter class used for messaging between components.
- Delete all UI-related code and remove jQuery as a dependency.
  - nES6 doesn't want to handle any of the page UI by design.
- Undo the use of global 'namespaces' (such as `Nes`) and switch to using `import`s.

And the list goes on. It took a bit of time, indeed. Eventually, I managed to get all the pieces connected and it ran! Huzzah! The issue, though, was that the framerate was subpar. Maybe hitting 30 FPS with stuttering. Totally unacceptable.

### Optimizing, or: The Fun Part

At this point, I'd worked on the web for a majority of my professional career, and have handled a few optimizations in my time. I can memoize functions all day, let me tell you. Using `console.time` and seeing a function call drop from `20ms` to `1ms` got me every time. And then I optimized nES6. Seeing and feeling a game become _objectively better_ after optimizing code is an awesome feeling.

After investigating the [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) flamechart, I dug into the code. After learning that the color palatte lookups were eating up cycles, I did what I know best: memoized. I cached the heck out of that color lookup function, I tell you what.

Maybe I didn't get it right the first time, but after fixing the cache, average FPS jumped up to acceptable ranges! Unhappy, I kept digging. 

Another major issue was garbage collection - tons of `Uint32Array`s created and tossed each frame, for instance. The most curious piece of all this is that WebNES runs just fine in the browser if you [try the demo](https://peteward44.github.io/WebNES/index_app.html). There are a number of potential causes: dependencies have updated, webpack generates more/different code, etc. Still a bit stumped on it, but hey. I fixed it.
