### Playtesting

- was huge
  - initial play test player's had a hard time figuring out what was what
    - yellow was used for an empty space, but the player thought colors denoted something important

<label>Original art style. An early playtest revealed that players didn't know what the yellow dots represented. They are later changed to something a bit more 'empty'.</label>

- lead to checkers combo
  - multiple times i played through and declared that HAD to be in the game because it really needed it

### Music

- music is a mystery
- tricoloren by xerxes? found a handful of artists that go by Xerxes but no direct connects
