I graduated from RIT in Rochester, NY in May of 2013 with a BFA in New Media Design & Imaging. Growing up as a developer my whole life, I had never really pursued art in any way. I decided to get a design degree (while in college for Game Design) in hopes to help balance my skills between design and development. A few art history classes later and I was a developer with design skills!

My first job out of school was at New York-based digital ad agency Firstborn. As a developer there, I created websites using HTML5 (JavaScript, CSS, etc), and became more familiar with tech such as Grunt, Node/npm, and TypeScript.

After getting hired by a small digital shop, I moved to Boulder, Colorado and worked on both small and large projects in Rails/Sitecore environments. I soon began working as a contract developer on my own, working for clients such as ad agencies and small startups. After a year or so of working freelance, I applied to Mozilla.

Currently, I am working remotely in Longmont, CO as a Front-End Engineer for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) on the Product Delivery team. When I'm not working, I like to study video game development, play with my dog Marley, and explore all the countless outdoorsy things you can do in Colorado!
